## Why the name?

The idea of creating Linefeed was born when I did Advent of Code 2024, where I wanted a language specifically tailored for writing clean solutions for Advent of Code:

1. It's a reference to having to read and print lines of text, each separated by a [line feed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newline).
2. It's a nod to the Christmassy origin of Advent of Code. The common acronym for line feed is **LF**, which sounds like **elf**.
