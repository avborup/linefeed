# Linefeed

A language specifically tailored for writing clean solutions for Advent of Code.


> [!WARNING]  
> It is currently in a _**very**_ early, exploratory stage.

## Examples

To demonstrate the syntax and features of Linefeed, solutions for Advent of Code 2020 have been implemented in Linefeed. They can be found in [`tests/linefeed/advent_of_code_2020`](https://github.com/avborup/linefeed/tree/main/linefeed/tests/linefeed/advent_of_code_2020).

## Planned features

See https://github.com/avborup/linefeed/issues/1 for a tracking issue.

## Why the name?

The idea of creating Linefeed was born when I did Advent of Code 2024, where I wanted a language specifically tailored for writing clean solutions for Advent of Code:

1. It's a reference to having to read and print lines of text, each separated by a [line feed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newline).
2. It's a nod to the Christmassy origin of Advent of Code. The common acronym for line feed is **LF**, which sounds like **elf**.
